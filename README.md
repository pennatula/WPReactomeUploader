After setting up the project in Eclipse, testing should be performed on a RCbranch, before uploading to the main website.



*** In Eclipse in the appropriate workspace, click on 'Window' -> 'Preferences'.
In the search field, enter encoding. Click under 'General' on 'Workspace'.
Set at 'Text File Encoding' (bottom left) UTF-8 under 'Other'.
